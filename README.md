# remove-marketo-styles

This JavaScript removes unneeded HTML divs, removes two forced CSS style sheets added to your HTML document, and removes inline CSS style for embedded Marketo forms.

It stops your site's HTML form elements' styles from fighting with those styles that Marketo sends with their forms.
