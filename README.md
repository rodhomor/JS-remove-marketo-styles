# remove-marketo-styles

This JavaScript removes unwanted / unneeded HTML divs and inline CSS style for embedded Marketo forms.

By doing so, it allows you to keep your form styles within your site's CSS file. 

And, it keeps you from having to "fight" with the styles that Marketo inline styles and two CSS files that is sent along with their forms.
